Since the test statistic was less than the p-value, we would reject the null hypothesis (the means are equal) and say that they are not equal. However, the p-value (0.714) is very large which means the evidence against the null hyptohesis is very weak. For this reason, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and say that the mean of the home and away win-percentage differentials for the 2020-2021 season is equal to the mean of the home and away win-percentage differentials from the 2015-2016 season to the 2019-2020 season."
